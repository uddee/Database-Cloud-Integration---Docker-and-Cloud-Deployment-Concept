# Database & Cloud Integration - Docker and Cloud Deployment Concept

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate a **backend web application** with **Docker** and deploy it to a **cloud platform**. The goal is to containerize a **Flask API**, which serves predictions from a trained machine learning model, and deploy it using **Docker** for local development and **cloud services** (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for production.

## Features

- **Flask API**: A simple web API that serves predictions using a machine learning model.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application and makes it easy to run anywhere.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Instructions to deploy the Dockerized application to cloud services like **AWS** or **Google Cloud**.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework to build the backend API.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google Cloud App Engine for deploying the containerized application.
- **SQLite**: Simple relational database used for storing predictions (optional for integration).

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- Docker (for containerization)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Cloud service account (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)

### 1. Clone the Repository
